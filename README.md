🚀 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Project
📖 Overview
This project leverages Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying the severity of the disease early and accurately, potentially preventing vision loss.

🛠️ Features
Preprocessing retinal images to enhance clarity for analysis.
Classification into five categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR.
Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
Achieves a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
📂 Dataset Structure
The dataset is divided into five labeled categories, stored in the one folder:
No_DR
Mild
Moderate
Severe
Proliferative_DR
🧪 Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
OpenCV for image processing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
⚙️ Workflow
Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
Model Training: Trained on CNN architecture with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation: Tested on a separate dataset for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

💡 Future Scope
Fine-tuning the model with larger datasets for improved accuracy.
Deploying the model as a web or mobile application for real-world use.
